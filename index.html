				<p>Robert Lanza, M.D. is currently Head of Astellas Global Regenerative
				 Medicine, and is Chief Scientific Officer of the Astellas Institute for
				 Regenerative Medicine and Adjunct Professor at Wake Forest University 
				 School of Medicine. His current research focuses on stem cells and 
				 regenerative medicine and their potential to provide therapies for some 
				 of the world’s most deadly and debilitating conditions.


				 Dr. Lanza has hundreds of publications and inventions, and over 30 
				scientific books, including “Principles of Tissue Engineering” and 
				“Essentials of Stem Cell Biology,” which are considered the definitive 
				references in the field. He received his BA and MD degrees from the 
				University of Pennsylvania, where he was both a University Scholar and 
				Benjamin Franklin Scholar. He was also a Fulbright Scholar, and was part 
				of the team that cloned the world’s first human embryo, as well as the 
				first to successfully generate stem cells from adults using somatic-cell 
				nuclear transfer (therapeutic cloning).</p>
