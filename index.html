				<p id="tribute-info">Robert Lanza, M.D. is currently Head of Astellas Global Regenerative
				 Medicine, and is Chief Scientific Officer of the Astellas Institute for
				 Regenerative Medicine and Adjunct Professor at Wake Forest University 
				 School of Medicine. His current research focuses on stem cells and 
				 regenerative medicine and their potential to provide therapies for some 
				 of the world’s most deadly and debilitating conditions.


				 Dr. Lanza has hundreds of publications and inventions, and over 30 
				scientific books, including “Principles of Tissue Engineering” and 
				“Essentials of Stem Cell Biology,” which are considered the definitive 
				references in the field. He received his BA and MD degrees from the 
				University of Pennsylvania, where he was both a University Scholar and 
				Benjamin Franklin Scholar. He was also a Fulbright Scholar, and was part 
				of the team that cloned the world’s first human embryo, as well as the 
				first to successfully generate stem cells from adults using somatic-cell 
				nuclear transfer (therapeutic cloning).</p>

				<p>Biocentrism is a theory proposed in 2007 by Robert Lanza, which sees 
					biology as the central driving science in the universe, and an 
					understanding of the other sciences as reliant on a deeper understanding
					of biology. Lanza believes that life and biology are central to being, 
					reality, and the cosmos—consciousness creates the universe rather than 
					the other way around. While physics is considered fundamental to the 
					study of the universe, and chemistry fundamental to the study of life, 
					Lanza claims that scientists will need to place biology before the other 
					sciences to produce a “theory of everything”.<br /><br />

					Biocentrism argues that the primacy of consciousness features in the work of René Descartes, Immanuel Kant, Gottfried Leibniz, George Berkeley, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Henri Bergson. He sees this as supporting the central claim that what we call space and time are forms of animal sense perception, rather than external physical objects.<br /><br />

					Robert Lanza argues that biocentrism offers insight into several major puzzles of science, including Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, the double-slit experiment, and the fine tuning of the forces, constants, and laws that shape the universe as we perceive it. According to Robert Lanza and Bob Berman, “biocentrism offers a more promising way to bring together all of physics, as scientists have been trying to do since Einstein’s unsuccessful unified field theories of eight decades ago.” <br /><br />

					Seven principles form the core of biocentrism. The first principle of biocentrism is based on the premise that what we observe is dependent on the observer, and says that what we perceive as reality is “a process that involves our consciousness.” The second and third principles state that “our external and internal perceptions are intertwined” and that the behavior of particles “is inextricably linked to the presence of an observer,” respectively. The fourth principle suggests that consciousness must exist and that without it “matter dwells in an undetermined state of probability.” The fifth principle points to the structure of the universe itself, and that the laws, forces, and constants of the universe appear to be fine-tuned for life. Finally, the sixth and seventh principles state that space and time are not objects or things, but rather tools of our animal understanding. Lanza says that we carry space and time around with us “like turtles with shells.”

				<p>Lanza’s work has been crucial to our understanding nuclear transfer and stem cell biology. In 2001 he was also the first to clone an endangered species (a Gaur), and in 2003, he cloned an endangered wild ox (a Banteng) from the frozen skin cells of an animal that had died at the San Diego Zoo nearly a quarter-of-a-century earlier. Lanza and his colleagues were also the first to demonstrate that nuclear transplantation could be used to reverse the aging process and to generate immune-compatible tissues, including the first organ tissue-engineered from cloned cells. One of his early achievements came from his demonstration that techniques used in preimplantation genetic diagnosis could be used to generate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) without embryonic destruction.

				He and colleagues have also succeeded in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells into retinal (RPE) cells, and has shown that they provide long-term benefit in animal models of vision loss. Using this technology some forms of blindness may be treatable, including macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, a currently untreatable form eye disease that causes blindness in teenagers and young adults. Lanza’s company just completed two clinical trials in the United States using them to treat degenerative eye diseases. ACT carried out the only pluripotent stem cell trial in Europe.</p>
